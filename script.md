# Colloquium Script


## The Standard Model (Sl. 1)

- SM -- Our current best model for particles and their interaction
- Rel. quantum field theory: Dynamics of fields described by a Lagrangian
  density
- Electromagnetic, Strong, Weak (3 out of 4) described by symmetry principle
  (local gauge invariance)
  - Local gauge transformations leave the Lagrangian unchanged
  - Problem: Particles cannot have masses, otherwise this would not hold!
- Solution from the 60s: Dynamical mass generation through symmetry breaking
  - Introduce a new scalar field phi (coupling to fermions & gauge bosons)
  - Key player the Higgs potential which causes Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
    and is a central element of this thesis


## Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (Sl. 2)

- This is a toy model of what this potential looks like
- Field zero -> symmetric state but unstable
  - Imagine a ball -- a tiny perturbation would roll it down the hill
- Lowest energy state (vacuum state): appears to break the symmetry
  - Value of the field in the vacuum state -> vacuum expectation value
- Cannot solve the Lagrangian directly: Have to use perturbation theory (about minimum)
  - Gives rise to masses for Gauge bosons
  - Moreover, the Yukawa couplings of Fermions to the Higgs field provides
    fermion masses proportional to the Yukawa coupling strength


## Higgs Discovery (Sl. 3)

- While this seems fairly abstract, the Higgs boson was discovered in 2012 by
  the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the LHC
- In the H->yy channel and H -> ZZ -> 4 lepton channel
- Mass of about 125 GeV
- Nobel prize awarded the following year


## 11 Years of Higgs Boson Measurements (Sl. 4)

- Higgs boson mass is known to per mille level
- Gauge boson and Yukawa couplings are in excellent agreement with the SM
  prediction
  - Many couplings observed and measured with ca. 10% precision
  - The line shows the mass-dependent coupling strength
  

## The Higgs Boson Self-Coupling (Sl. 5)

- This is the Higgs potential expanded about the vacuum state
- With the discovery of the Higgs boson, we have a direct experimental
  measurement of the first term, which determines the mass of the Higgs boson.
- In the SM, the remaining terms are thus fully determined. However, we have
  never explicitly measured them.
  - These terms describe couplings between three or four Higgs bosons (Higgs
    boson self-coupling)


## (Sl. 6)

- Deformations of the Higgs potential yielding the same Higgs mass but different
  higher-order terms
- Possible in BSM theories!
- We probe this experimentally!
